Goal of Scoring Calibration

We want:

Logical consistency

No contradictory signals

Smooth transition between risk levels

High recall (don’t miss scams)

Clean explanation story

🚨 Problem With Current Formula

You’re using:

Final Score = (0.4 × Rule Score) + (0.6 × ML Probability)

But:

Rule Score is 0–1

ML Probability is 0–1

Thresholds are fixed

This causes edge issues:

Example Case:

Rule Score = 0
ML = 0.95

Final = 0.57

→ Medium risk
But ML clearly thinks scam.

This looks broken.

✅ Fix Strategy: Tiered Override Logic

Instead of pure linear blending, use calibrated hybrid logic.

We’ll apply 3-stage calibration.

🧠 Step 1: Normalize Rule Score Properly

Currently rule score = sum(weights)

But that makes:

1 rule trigger look weak

Multiple triggers explode score

Instead do:

Rule Score = triggered_weight / total_active_weight

This keeps it proportional.

🧠 Step 2: Introduce Confidence Zones for ML

Instead of treating ML as linear:

Define zones:

ML Probability	Meaning
0–0.35	Likely Legit
0.36–0.65	Uncertain
0.66–0.85	Likely Fraud
0.86–1.0	Strong Fraud

This gives semantic clarity.

🧠 Step 3: Replace Linear Fusion with Calibrated Logic

Instead of:

Final = weighted average

Use:

🔴 Rule 1: High ML Override

If:

ML >= 0.85

→ Final Risk = High
Regardless of rule score.

Reason:
High ML confidence means strong fraud pattern.

🟠 Rule 2: High Rule Override

If:

Rule Score >= 0.6

→ Minimum risk = High

Because explicit fraud indicators triggered.

🟡 Rule 3: Moderate Blend

If both moderate:

Use weighted formula:

Final = (0.5 × ML) + (0.5 × Rule)

Then classify:

< 0.35 → Low
0.35–0.65 → Medium

0.65 → High

🧪 Let’s Test With Your Example

Rule = 0
ML = 0.95

→ ML >= 0.85

→ High Risk

Much cleaner.

🧪 Another Example

Rule = 0.7
ML = 0.4

Rule >= 0.6

→ High Risk

Makes sense (explicit fraud signals).

🧪 Moderate Case

Rule = 0.2
ML = 0.55

Blend:

Final = 0.375

→ Medium

Reasonable.

🧠 Step 4: Calibrate Thresholds Using Your Test Set

After training:

Run validation set.

Try thresholds:

0.4
0.45
0.5

Pick one that:

Maximizes recall

Keeps precision acceptable

Document chosen threshold.

Judges love threshold reasoning.

🧠 Step 5: Align UI With Logic

Important:

If you override via ML high confidence:

Display:

“High Risk – Strong AI Fraud Pattern Detected”

If override via rules:

Display:

“High Risk – Explicit Fraud Indicators Found”

This improves explainability.

🎯 Final Recommended Hybrid Algorithm (Production-Grade MVP)

Pseudo-code:

if ml_prob >= 0.85:
    risk = "High"
elif rule_score >= 0.6:
    risk = "High"
else:
    final_score = (0.5 * ml_prob) + (0.5 * rule_score)

    if final_score < 0.35:
        risk = "Low"
    elif final_score < 0.65:
        risk = "Medium"
    else:
        risk = "High"

Return:

final_score

PART 1 — Fix Probability-to-UI Mapping
🚨 Problem Right Now

You’re showing:

Medium Risk

57% Fraud Probability

AI Score: 95/100

Rule Score: 0

That confuses users.

Users do NOT care about:

Raw model score

Internal weighted logic

They care about:

Is it dangerous?

What should I do?

✅ New Probability → UI Strategy

We separate:

1️⃣ Decision Layer (What user sees first)

🎨 NEW RISK MAPPING DESIGN

Instead of showing raw % directly as headline, do this:

🔴 High Risk

If:

ML ≥ 0.85
OR

Rule ≥ 0.6
OR

Final ≥ 0.65

Display:

⚠️ Likely Fraudulent Message

Subtext:

Strong indicators suggest this message may be a scam.

Probability badge (small, secondary):

82% Risk Confidence

Notice wording change:

NOT “Fraud Probability”

Instead “Risk Confidence”

This feels intentional and less accusatory.

🟡 Medium Risk

If:
0.35–0.65

Display:

⚠️ Suspicious Message

Subtext:

Some risk signals detected. Proceed with caution.

Probability badge:

54% Risk Confidence

🟢 Low Risk

If < 0.35

Display:

✅ Likely Safe Message

Subtext:

No major fraud indicators detected.

Probability badge:

18% Risk Confidence

🔥 IMPORTANT CHANGE

Stop showing:

AI Score 95/100

Rule Score 0/100

Instead show:
